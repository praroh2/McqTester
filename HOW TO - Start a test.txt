* Open simpleStart.py in Idle and run it (F5).

* Select option 1.

* Read the instructions carefully.

* Ask for the question set that you have to answer and the key required to 
  view the contents.

* If you wish to leave the test for any reason, close it (Ctrl + C). You can 
  continue later. You will not be asked to solve all questions again.

* You need not open any other file. simpleStart.py is the only file that you
  should open.
