* Open simpleStart.py in Idle and run it (F5).

* Read the instructions carefully.

* Ask for the name of the question set that you have to answer and the key 
  required to view the contents.

* If you wish to leave the test for any reason, close it (Ctrl + C). You can 
  continue later. You will not be asked to solve all questions again.

* You need not open or run any piece of code. simpleStart.py is the only file 
  that you should open.
