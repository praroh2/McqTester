There are two ways to create question sets.

1. generateQfileManually - You are asked to enter the question, options, correct
option and score associated with each question. This is a time consuming process
with quite a few steps for adding each question and shouldn't be used.

2. generateQfilefromIpFile - Enter the question, options, correct option and
score into a file in the format given below. Then run generateQfilefromIpFile.
Set a key to encrypt contents.

When the output file is the same as the input file the existing content will be 
deleted if opened in 'w' mode. Do not do this unless you are sure that all the 
records that you have enterred are perfectly fine. Else you will lose the 
erraneous records.

Ideally: Set the output file to be something other than the input file itself.
Open the output file in mode 'w' first. If there are any erraneous records in the
input file they will not be written into the output file but will be displayed on
the screen. Make the necessary changes and then you may write all the questions
into the output file again in mode 'w'.
Alternate: Delete the records that have been accepted and write to output file in
mode 'a' after correcting the errors.


Steps to create question set:
1. Open a new file input.txt.
2. Enter records in the format:
QuesLine1###QuesLine2...###QuesLineN######Op1Line1...###Op1LineN######Op2Line1...###Op2LineN######Op3Line1...###Op3LineN######Op4Line1...###Op4LineN######CorrectAnswer(1-4)######Score######

ex:

int i = 3, j = 4;###float k;###k = float(i + j + 1.0);######2######7######    6######None of the above######4######1######

will finally be displayed as:

Question:
int i = 3, j = 4;
float k;
k = float(i + j + 1.0);

Option 1:
2

Option 2:
7

Option 3:
    6

Option 4:
None of the above

* There are six #'s (######) seperating different fields.
* There are three #'s (###) seperating different lines of a given field.
* Six #'s have to be enterred before ending a line.
* All the fields of a record must be present on a single line. Having some fields
  on a different line will lead to an error.
